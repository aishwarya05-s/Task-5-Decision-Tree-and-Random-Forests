Conclusions:

1. Dependent variable "target" appears to be approximately balanced with categories as 0 and 1.

2. There is a moderate positive correlation between cp(chest pain) and the target variable.

3. The variables thalach and target also have moderate positive correlation.

4. The slope of the peak exercise ST segment and target also have a moderate positive correlation.

5. Decision tree classifier classified the data correctly with an accuracy of 0.70 and using Cross validation the accuracy increased upto 0.76.

6. Random Forest classifier classified the data correctly with an accuracy of 0.78 and using Cross validation the accuracy increased upto 0.86.

7. Comparing the accuracy score of both classifier we conclude that Random Forest Classifier is better classifier than decision tree classifier.
